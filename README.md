# African Restaurant E-Commerce App

Welcome to the African Restaurant E-Commerce App! This project is an online platform where users can explore, order, and purchase authentic African cuisine from the comfort of their homes. The app features a dynamic menu, shopping cart, and secure checkout process, providing a seamless experience for both customers and restaurant owners.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**  

If you want full control over the build configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject. All other scripts will still work but will reference the copied configurations. You donâ€™t have to use this unless you need advanced customization.
